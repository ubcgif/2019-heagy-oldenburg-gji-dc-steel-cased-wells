    Cross section showing: (a) electrical conductivity, (b) current density, (c) charge density, and
    (d) electric field for a DC resistivity experiment with a conductive target (top)
    and a resistive target (bottom) which is not in contact with the well.
    The positive electrode is positioned in the casing at the 912.5 m depth.
    The casing is shown by the black line that extends to 1 km
    depth in panel (a).
