    Cross section showing: (a) electrical conductivity, (b) current density, (c) charge density,
    and (d) electric field for a top-casing DC resistivity experiment over models with a conductive layer
    (top two rows) and a model with a resistive layer (bottom two rows). In all, the layer extends from
    400 m to 450 m depth. The plots in the second and fourth rows show the model, currents, charges and electric
    fields for a well with a 10m flaw at 500 m depth.
