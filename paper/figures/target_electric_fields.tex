\caption{
    Radial electric field at the surface as the conductivity of a cylindrical target, in contact with the well,
    is varied. The target has a radius of 25 m and extends in depth from 900 m to 925 m. The return electrode
    is on the surface, 500 m from the well and data are measured along a line perpendicular to the source.
    The panels on the left show
    (a) the total electric field, (b) the secondary electric field with respect to a primary that does not include the target,
    and (c) the secondary electric field as a percentage of the primary for a survey in which the positive electrode is
    positioned downhole at 912.5 m depth. The panels on the right similarly show (d) the total electric field, (e) the
    secondary electric field, and (f) the secondary electric field as a percentage of the primary for a top-casing experiment.
