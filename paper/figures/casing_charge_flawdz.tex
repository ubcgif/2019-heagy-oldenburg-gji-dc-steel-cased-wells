    Charge along the length of a 50 m long intact well (black),
    a 25 m well (``short'', grey dash-dot), and four wells, each with a flaw
    starting at 25m depth and extending the length indicated by the legend
    ($5 \times 10^{-1}$ m (blue), $5 \times 10^{-2}$ m (orange), and $5 \times 10^{-3}$ m (green))
    in a top-casing DC resistivity experiment.
    For reference, the diameter of the casing is $10^{-1}$ m and its thickness is $10^{-2}$ m.
    The return electrode
    is 50 m away from the well and a cylindrically symmetric mesh was used in the simulation.
